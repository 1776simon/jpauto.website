> how can we commit changes to github without triggering site redeploy? 

● There are several strategies to commit changes without triggering a site
  redeploy:

  1. Use Feature Branches (Current Approach)

  You're already on the inventory-landing-redesign branch. If your
  deployments only watch the master branch, committing to this feature
  branch won't trigger a redeploy:

  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  git push origin inventory-landing-redesign

  2. Use [skip ci] in Commit Messages

  Many CI/CD platforms recognize skip directives in commit messages:

  git commit -m "WIP: Update styling [skip ci]"
  # or
  git commit -m "WIP: Update styling [ci skip]"

  Common variations:
  - [skip ci] or [ci skip]
  - [skip actions] (GitHub Actions)
  - [skip pages] (GitHub Pages - may not work)

  3. Configure Deployment Branches

  Check your deployment configurations:

  - GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Branch
  - Cloudflare Pages: Only deploys configured branches (usually main)
  - Railway: Settings → Deployment triggers

  4. Temporarily Disable Auto-Deploy

  For platforms that support it, you can temporarily pause automatic
  deployments:
  - Cloudflare Pages: Pause deployments in project settings
  - Railway: Disable auto-deploy in settings

  Current Situation

  Looking at your git status, you're on inventory-landing-redesign branch
  with changes to Jekyll files. Since your main site deploys from the master
   branch, you can safely commit to this feature branch without triggering a
   production deployment:

  git add .
  git commit -m "Continue inventory landing page redesign"
  git push origin inventory-landing-redesign

  Would you like me to help you commit these changes to the feature branch?

> I don't believe we have inventory-ladning-redesign branch, can you check? 

● Bash(git branch -a)
  ⎿  * inventory-landing-redesign          
       master
       remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
       remotes/origin/master

● You're right to question it! The inventory-landing-redesign branch does 
  exist locally (you're currently on it), but it hasn't been pushed to 
  GitHub yet.

  Looking at the output:
  - Local branches: inventory-landing-redesign (current), master
  - Remote branches: Only master exists on GitHub

  This means you created or switched to this branch locally, but it's never
  been pushed to the remote repository.

  Your Options:

  Option 1: Commit to Local Branch (Safe - No Deploy)

  git add .
  git commit -m "Continue inventory landing page redesign"
  # Don't push yet - stays local only

  Option 2: Push New Branch to GitHub (Still Safe - No Deploy)

  git add .
  git commit -m "Continue inventory landing page redesign"
  git push -u origin inventory-landing-redesign
  This creates the branch on GitHub but won't trigger a Jekyll deploy (only
  master triggers that).

  Option 3: Use [skip ci] on Master

  If you want to commit directly to master without deploying:
  git checkout master
  git add .
  git commit -m "WIP: Inventory redesign [skip ci]"
  git push origin master

  Recommendation: Use Option 2 - commit and push to the feature branch. It
  keeps your work backed up on GitHub without affecting the live site.

  Which approach would you prefer?

computer 

● Bash(git add .)

● Bash(git commit -m "Continue inventory landing page redesign - WIP")
  ⎿ [inventory-landing-redesign 0ff2c43] Continue inventory landing page re
    design - WIP
     12 files changed, 799 insertions(+), 302 deletions(-)
    … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


● Bash(git push -u origin inventory-landing-redesign)
  ⎿ branch 'inventory-landing-redesign' set up to track 'origin/inventory-l

    remote:

● Bash(git branch -a)
  ⎿  * inventory-landing-redesign          
       master
       remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! ✓ The inventory-landing-redesign branch has been successfully
  created on GitHub.

  What was done:
  1. Staged all your modified files (12 files changed)
  2. Committed the changes with message "Continue inventory landing page
  redesign - WIP"
  3. Pushed the branch to GitHub and set up tracking

  Verification:
  You can now see the branch on GitHub:
  - Remote branch: remotes/origin/inventory-landing-redesign
  - Branch URL: https://github.com/1776simon/jpauto.website/tree/inventory-l
  anding-redesign

  To work on this from another computer:
  git clone https://github.com/1776simon/jpauto.website.git
  cd jpauto.website
  git checkout inventory-landing-redesign

  Or if you already have the repo cloned:
  git fetch origin
  git checkout inventory-landing-redesign

  Important: This branch won't trigger any deployments. Only commits to
  master will deploy to your production site. You can work freely on this
  branch and merge to master when you're ready to go live.
