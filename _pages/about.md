## Our Story

JP AUTO has been proudly serving the Sacramento community since 2005. As a family-owned and operated dealership, we've built our reputation on honesty, transparency, and providing quality pre-owned vehicles at fair prices.

What started as a small lot with a handful of vehicles has grown into one of Sacramento's most trusted sources for quality used cars. Our success is built on simple principles: treat every customer with respect, stand behind every vehicle we sell, and always do the right thing.

## Our Mission

**To provide Sacramento and surrounding communities with access to reliable, quality pre-owned vehicles backed by exceptional customer service and transparent business practices.**

We believe car buying should be straightforward, honest, and even enjoyable. That's why we've eliminated the pressure tactics and hidden fees common in the automotive industry. When you shop at JP AUTO, you get:

- **Transparent Pricing** - No hidden fees, no surprises
- **Quality Vehicles** - Every car passes our 150-point inspection
- **Honest Communication** - We tell you what you need to know
- **Fair Trade-Ins** - Competitive values for your current vehicle
- **Flexible Financing** - Options for all credit situations

## Our Values

### Integrity

We build trust through honesty and transparency. Every vehicle history is disclosed, every inspection report is available, and every price is fair and competitive.

### Quality

We never compromise on the quality of our vehicles. Each car undergoes a rigorous inspection, and we only sell vehicles we'd be proud to have our own families drive.

### Customer Service

You're not just a transaction - you're part of the JP AUTO family. We're here to help before, during, and long after your purchase.

### Community

As a local business, we're committed to giving back to the Sacramento community that has supported us for nearly two decades.

## What Makes Us Different

### 150-Point Inspection

Every vehicle in our inventory undergoes a comprehensive inspection by certified technicians. We check everything from engine performance to interior condition, ensuring you get a reliable vehicle.

### No-Pressure Sales

Our team is here to help you find the right vehicle, not to pressure you into a sale. Take your time, ask questions, and test drive as many cars as you need.

### Warranty Included

We stand behind our vehicles with comprehensive warranty options, giving you peace of mind with every purchase.

### Financing for All Credit Situations

We work with multiple lenders to secure financing for customers with all credit backgrounds - from excellent to challenged credit.
