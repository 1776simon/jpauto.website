## Important: AS-IS Sales Policy

**All vehicles at JP AUTO are sold "AS-IS" without dealer warranty.** This means we do not provide our own warranty coverage beyond what may remain from the original manufacturer's warranty.

---

## What "AS-IS" Means

When you purchase a vehicle "AS-IS," you are buying it in its current condition. The vehicle is sold:

- Without any express or implied warranties from JP AUTO
- In the condition it was in at the time of sale
- With all faults, whether known or unknown to the buyer

**You accept the vehicle in its present state**, and we are not responsible for any repairs or issues that may arise after purchase.

---

## Manufacturer's Warranty

### If Applicable

Some vehicles in our inventory may still be covered under the **original manufacturer's warranty**. If a manufacturer's warranty applies to your vehicle:

- ✓ The warranty terms are set by the manufacturer, not JP AUTO
- ✓ Warranty coverage and duration vary by manufacturer and vehicle age/mileage
- ✓ You must follow the manufacturer's warranty procedures for claims
- ✓ Repairs must be performed at authorized manufacturer service centers
- ✓ JP AUTO is not responsible for warranty claim denials or disputes

### Verifying Warranty Coverage

Before purchasing, we can help you:

- Check if remaining manufacturer warranty exists
- Provide manufacturer warranty documentation (if available)
- Direct you to the manufacturer for warranty details
- Explain warranty transferability (varies by manufacturer)

**It is your responsibility to verify warranty coverage and terms directly with the manufacturer before purchase.**

## Pre-Purchase Inspection Recommendation

**We strongly encourage you to have any vehicle independently inspected by a mechanic of your choice before purchase.**

### Your Right to Inspect

You have the right to:

- ✓ Have the vehicle inspected by your own mechanic
- ✓ Take the vehicle for a pre-purchase inspection
- ✓ Request maintenance records (if available)
- ✓ Ask questions about the vehicle's condition
- ✓ Take a thorough test drive

**We welcome independent inspections** and will provide reasonable access to the vehicle for this purpose. Schedule an appointment with us to arrange an inspection.

## After-Sale Repairs

### Your Responsibility

Once you purchase a vehicle AS-IS:

- **You are responsible for all repairs and maintenance** after the sale
- We do not cover repair costs for any issues discovered after purchase
- Normal wear items (brakes, tires, batteries, etc.) are your responsibility
- Maintenance and service are at your expense

### Cosmetic and Minor Repairs

**Cosmetic or minor issues** that do not affect the vehicle's operation, safety, or drivability:

- Are **not** covered or warranted by JP AUTO
- May be repaired prior to sale if practical and cost-effective
- Are disclosed when significant (e.g., visible body damage)
- Are typically reflected in the vehicle's pricing

Examples of non-warrantied items:
- Door lock actuators (if locks work manually)
- Power window motors (if windows can be manually opened/closed safely)
- Non-functional radio or speakers
- Cosmetic trim pieces
- Vanity mirrors or interior lights

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: If something breaks right after I buy it, will you fix it?**

A: No. Once you purchase a vehicle AS-IS, all repairs are your responsibility, even if an issue occurs shortly after purchase. This is why we strongly recommend a pre-purchase inspection.

**Q: What if I find an issue during my test drive?**

A: Let us know immediately. If it's a safety or major operational issue, we may address it before sale or adjust the price accordingly. If it's a minor cosmetic issue, it's likely already factored into the pricing.

**Q: Can I return the vehicle if I change my mind?**

A: All sales are final. There is no "cooling off" period or return policy. Make sure you're confident in your decision before purchasing.

**Q: Do you offer any kind of warranty at all?**

A: We do not offer dealer warranties. However, some vehicles may have remaining manufacturer's warranty. Additionally, you may purchase third-party extended warranties at your discretion.

**Q: What happens if the check engine light comes on after I buy it?**

A: You are responsible for diagnosing and repairing any issues that arise after purchase, including check engine lights. This is why thorough pre-purchase inspection is important.

**Q: Are there any exceptions to the AS-IS policy?**

A: No. All vehicles are sold AS-IS without exception. However, we are legally required to disclose known material defects, and we take that responsibility seriously.
